# GenQuery

GenQuery is a query interface generator.  It is designed to allow you to put up and customise a
CGI interface on your SQL database in a matter of minutes.

In the age of HTML5 and web applications it looks a bit dated, but it still does the job!

GenQuery was moved to GitHub from SF.net in 2015.

See the Guide document (guide.odt) for full instructions.
