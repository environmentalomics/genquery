A GenQuery package is provided to aid installation on Debian GNU/Linux.  For users of other
systems, this file contains some notes on how to install the GenQuery software.

We do not currently have the resources to maintain packages for other platforms
or a generic installation script.  However I would welcome any offers of
packages or improved installation notes if anyone is prepared to offer them.

Please also see the guide.pdf ditributed with the package.

Steps to install:

1) Prerequisites

To run the system for yourself you will need a web server capable of serving
Perl CGI scripts. The recommended system is Debian GNU/Linux with Apache, for
which a .deb package is available from the Bio-Linux package repository, but
the software should run happily on any modern Unix and maybe even Windows (untested)
if installed manually.  Genquery can connect to PostgreSQL and MySQL databases, and 
should work on anything for which there is a DBI driver, but YMMV.

For non-Debian systems, you will need to make sure you have the following:

    * Perl 5.8
    * A PostgreSQL/MySQL database to query (need not be on the same machine as GenQuery)
    * A working web server (e.g. Apache) with CGI enabled
    * These Perl modules, available from cpan.org:
          o CGI
          o DBD::Pg and/or DBD::mysql
          o Text::CSV_XS (optional)
          o IO::String
	  o HTML::Template
	  o CGI::Application
	  o CGI::Application::Plugin::Forward
	  o String::Tokenizer
	  o XML::Simple
	  o XML::Writer (optional)
	  o YAML

2) Install modules

Inside the tarball there is a perl5 directory.  Copy the contents of this to somewhere in 
your Perl module path - eg. /usr/local/lib/site_perl

3) Install web content

Inside the tarball there is a www directory.  Put these files in an appropriate
location to be served by Apache.  The reccommended location is /var/www/genquery.

*Note* - if you are setting up GenQuery for Handlebar then you can stop here.  Handlebar 
ships with its own CGI scripts and configuration.

There is also a cgi-bin directory.  The files from here need to go in a script-aliased
web directory, typically /var/www/cgi-bin/genquery.

4) Setup database

If you want to add queries to the database, rather than storing them in the external 
configuration file, run the inlcuded make_tables.sql file from the share directory to 
create the required tables in your database.  

5) Configure

Copy the templates and sample configuration file from the conf directory to, for example, 
/etc/handlebar.

Copy the sample configuration file and edit your copy to suit your needs - for example you can set the database 
to query and change default file locations.
GenQuery is run from the stub CGI script 'gq.cgi' which you have already copied to the cgi-bin directory;
edit this script to point to your new configuration file.

See the comments in both files, as well as the guide document, for more details.

5) Try it - point a browser at http://localhost/cgi-bin/genquery/gq.cgi

This should be sufficient to get going, but due to the large range of possible configurations I cannot
provide exhaustive instructions, so you may have to apply some cunning.  Good luck!
